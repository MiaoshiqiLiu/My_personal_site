  The Association Between ICU Patients’ Social Visits and Survival

  * Independently established a research project investigating the association between ICU patients’ social visits and survival, an under-explored field in medical data

  * Conclusion: According to logistic regression, positive social visits are correlated with higher in-hospital mortality, but after using PSM between the two groups, it turns out that whether the social visits are positive or not does not clearly influence the in-hospital mortality.
